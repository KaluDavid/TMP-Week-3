        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome To Strathallan School </h1>
        <br><br>
        <h2> Headmaster's Welcome</h2>
        <br>
        <p> I am delighted to offer you a warm welcome to Strathallan. I am personally very proud of this school and the
            all-round, inclusive and holistic education you will find here.

            Offering a broad, inclusive education has been a core component of Strathallan’s ethos since the school was
            founded in 1913. Strathallan has always set out to bring out the best in every pupil and I am committed and
            determined to continue to nurture this culture today.

            We have high expectations at Strathallan and this encourages our pupils to believe in themselves, to be
            inquisitive, to be resilient and to show ambition both in and out of the classroom. Our pupils feel happy
            and valued, which gives them the confidence, enthusiasm and social awareness for life-long learning needed
            to succeed in a fast-changing world.

            We value respect for tradition alongside openness to innovation. We encourage our pupils to work with and
            learn from each other, whilst also showing courage to stand up for what they believe. I am confident that we
            can challenge and develop all those who come to us at whatever age, stretching the most able whilst
            supporting those who need a helping hand.

            Our aim is to send our pupils out into the world with strong friendships already forged and the ability to
            make new ones, with the knowledge and skills to succeed at university and beyond, and with a broad range of
            interests to enrich their lives.

            I hope that you will find our website helpful and that it offers a glimpse of what our school is all about.
            From the beauty and scale of our campus to the culture and values we stand for, the best way to truly
            appreciate what Strathallan is all about is to see it for yourself.

            I do hope you will come and visit the school, see first-hand what Strathallan does each and every day, and
            find out what it could do for you, too.</p>
